    Problem 2: Contextual bandit problem 
    In this problem, you will implement an AI player for contextual multi-armed bandit problem epsilon-greedy method.
    The main goal of this problem is to get familiar with a simplified problem in reinforcement learning, and how to train the model parameters on the data from a game.
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test2.py` in the terminal.

class CBandit:
    '''CBandit is a Contextual Multi-armed bandit machine. The odds of the winning for each lever also depends on the context (the state) of the machine. 
        For example, the machine can have two states, say a green light on the screen, or a red light on the screen. 
        The state of the machine can be observed by the player. '''

                    p[i,j] represents the winning probability of the machine at i-th state and the j-th arm is being pulled by the player.
